The goal of this project is to create a URL shortner designed to be run within a corporation using OAuth for authentication and identity management. I'm also planning on using a modern JS framework for the UI - mostly as a learning excercise. 

The intention of this project is to be a feature rich URL Shortner that will be sutable for use and as a demo app for presentations.
